	Monika	Hi again, [player]!
	Monika	Glad to see you didn't run away on us. Hahaha!
	MC	Nah, don't worry.
	MC	This might be a little strange for me, but I at least keep my word.
	Narrator	Well, I'm back at the Literature Club.
	Narrator	I was the last to come in, so everyone else is already hanging out.
	Yuri	Thanks for keeping your promise, [player].
	Yuri	I hope this isn't too overwhelming of a commitment for you.
	Yuri	Making you dive headfirst into literature when you're not accustomed to it...
	Natsuki	Oh, come on! Like he deserves any slack.
	Natsuki	You already had to be dragged here by Monika.
	Natsuki	I don't know if you plan to just come here and hang out, or what...
	Natsuki	But if you don't take us seriously, then you won't see the end of it.
	Monika	Natsuki, you certainly have a big mouth for someone who keeps her manga collection in the clubroom.
	Natsuki	M-M-M...!!
	Narrator	Natsuki finds herself stuck between saying \"Monika\" and \"Manga\".
	Natsuki	Manga is literature!!
	Narrator	Swiftly defeated, Natsuki plops back into her seat.
	Yuri	I'm sorry, [player]...
	Yuri	We'll make sure to put your comfort first, okay?
	Narrator	Yuri shoots Natsuki with a disappointed glance.
	Yuri	Um, anyway...
	Yuri	Now that you're in the club and all...
	Yuri	...Perhaps you might have interest in picking up a book to read?
	MC	Well...
	MC	I can't really say no either way.
	MC	Like you said, I'm in this club now.
	MC	So it only feels right for me to do something like that, if you ask.
	Yuri	W-Wait...
	Yuri	I didn't mean it like that!
	Yuri	Uu...
	Yuri	If you don't really want to, then forget I said anything, I guess...
	MC	Ah--No, it's not that, Yuri.
	MC	I want to try to be a part of this club.
	MC	So even if I don't read often, I'd be happy to pick up a book if you wanted me to.
	Yuri	A-Are you sure...?
	Yuri	I just felt like...
	Yuri	...Well, as Vice President and all...
	Yuri	...That I should help you get started on something you might like.
	Narrator	Yuri reaches into her bag and pulls out a book.
	Yuri	I didn't want you to feel left out...
	Yuri	So I picked out a book that I thought you might enjoy.
	Yuri	It's a short read, so it should keep your attention, even if you don't usually read.
	Yuri	And we could, you know...
	Yuri	Discuss it...if you wanted...
	Narrator	Th-This is...
	Narrator	How is this girl accidentally being so cute?
	Narrator	She even picked out a book she thinks I'll like, despite me not reading much...
	MC	Yuri, thank you! I'll definitely read this!
	Narrator	I enthusiastically take the book.
	Yuri	Phew...
	Yuri	Well, you can read it at your own pace.
	Yuri	I look forward to hearing what you think.
	Narrator	Now that everyone's settled in, I expected Monika to kick off some scheduled activities for the club.
	Narrator	But that doesn't seem to be the case.
	Narrator	Yuri's face is already buried in a book.
	Narrator	I can't help but notice her intense expression, like she was waiting for this chance.
	Narrator	Meanwhile, Natsuki is rummaging around in the closet.
	Narrator	_exclusive2_" + str(eval(poemwinner[0][0] + "_appeal
	MC	Phew...
	Narrator	I guess that's everyone.
	Narrator	I glance around the room.
	Narrator	That was a little more stressful than I anticipated.
	Narrator	It's as if everyone is judging me for my mediocre writing abilities...
	Narrator	Even if they're just being nice, there's no way my poems can stand up to theirs.
	Narrator	This is a literature club, after all.
	Narrator	I sigh.
	Narrator	I guess that's what I ended up getting myself into.
	Narrator	Across the room, Monika is writing something in her notebook.
	Narrator	My eyes land on Yuri and Natsuki.
	Narrator	They gingerly exchange sheets of paper, sharing their respective poems.
	Narrator	As they read in tandem, I watch each of their expressions change.
	Narrator	Natsuki's eyebrows furrow in frustration.
	Narrator	Meanwhile, Yuri smiles sadly.
	Natsuki	{i}(What's with this language...?){/i}
	Yuri	Eh?
	Yuri	Um...did you say something?
	Natsuki	Oh, it's nothing.
	Narrator	Natsuki dismissively returns the poem to the desk with one hand.
	Natsuki	I guess you could say it's fancy.
	Yuri	Ah-- Thanks...
	Yuri	Yours is...cute...
	Natsuki	Cute?
	Natsuki	Did you completely miss the symbolism or something?
	Natsuki	It's clearly about the feeling of giving up.
	Natsuki	How can that be cute?
	Yuri	I-I know that!
	Yuri	I just meant...
	Yuri	The language, I guess...
	Yuri	I was trying to say something nice...
	Natsuki	Eh?
	Natsuki	You mean you have to try that hard to come up with something nice to say?
	Natsuki	Thanks, but it really didn't come out nice at all!
	Yuri	Um...
	Yuri	Well, I do have a couple suggestions...
	Natsuki	Hmph.
	Natsuki	If I was looking for suggestions, I would have asked someone who actually liked it.
	Natsuki	Which people {i}did{/i}, by the way.
	Natsuki	Monika liked it.
	Natsuki	And [player] did, too!
	Natsuki	So based on that, I'll gladly give you some suggestions of my own.
	Natsuki	First of all--
	Yuri	Excuse me...
	Yuri	I appreciate the offer, but I've spent a long time establishing my writing style.
	Yuri	I don't expect it to change anytime soon, unless of course I come across something particularly inspiring.
	Yuri	Which I haven't yet.
	Natsuki	Nn...!
	Yuri	And [player] liked my poem too, you know.
	Yuri	He even told me he was impressed by it.
	Narrator	Natsuki suddenly stands up.
	Natsuki	Oh?
	Natsuki	I didn't realize you were so invested in trying to impress our new member, Yuri.
	Yuri	E-Eh?!
	Yuri	That's not what I...!
	Yuri	Uu...
	Yuri	You...You're just...
	Narrator	Yuri stands up as well.
	Yuri	Maybe you're just jealous that [player] appreciates my advice more than he appreciated yours!
	Natsuki	Huh! And how do you know he didn't appreciate {i}my{/i} advice more?
	Natsuki	Are you that full of yourself?
	Yuri	I...!
	Yuri	No...
	Yuri	If I was full of myself...
	Yuri	...I would deliberately go out of my way to make everything I do overly cutesy!
	Natsuki	Uuuuuu...!
	Natsuki	Well, you know what?!
	Natsuki	I wasn't the one whose boobs magically grew a size bigger as soon as [player] started showing up!!
	Yuri	N-Natsuki!!
	Monika	Um, Natsuki, that's a little--
	Natsuki/Yuri	This doesn't involve you!
	Yuri	Taking out your own insecurities on others like that...
	Yuri	You really act as young as you look, Natsuki.
	Natsuki	{i}Me?{/i} Look who's talking, you wannabe edgy bitch!
	Yuri	Edgy...?
	Yuri	Sorry that my lifestyle is too much for someone of your mental age to comprehend!
	Natsuki	See??
	Natsuki	Just saying that proves my point!
	Natsuki	Most people learn to get over themselves after they graduate middle school, you know.
	Yuri	If you want to prove anything, then stop harassing others with your sickening attitude!
	Yuri	You think you can counterbalance your toxic personality just by dressing and acting cute?
	Yuri	The only cute thing about you is how hard you try.
	Natsuki	Whoa, be careful or you might cut yourself on that edge, Yuri.
	Natsuki	Oh, my bad... You already do, don't you?
	Yuri	D-Did you just accuse me of cutting myself??
	Yuri	What the fuck is wrong with your head?!
	Natsuki	Yeah, go on!
	Natsuki	Let [player] hear everything you really think!
	Natsuki	I'm sure he'll be head over heels for you after this!
	Yuri	A-Ah--!
	Narrator	Suddenly, Yuri turns toward me, as if she just noticed I was standing here.
	Yuri	[player]...!
	Yuri	She-- She's just trying to make me look bad...!
	Natsuki	That's not true!
	Natsuki	She started it!
	MC	...
	Narrator	{cps=*2}How did I get dragged into this in the first place?!{/cps}{nw}
	Narrator	{cps=*2}It's not like I know anything about writing...{/cps}{nw}
	Narrator	{cps=*2}But whomever I agree with, they'll probably think more highly of me!{/cps}{nw}
	Narrator	{cps=*2}So, of course that's going to be...!{/cps}{nw}
	Narrator	Natsuki.

	Monika	...
	Monika	...
	Monika	...
	Monika	Um...
	Monika	Hey, [player]...
	Monika	Why don't we\nstep outside for\na little bit?
	Monika	Okay?
	Monika	Sorry about that...
	Monika	They really shouldn't have tried to get you involved.
	Monika	It's probably better for us to stay out of this...
	Monika	We'll go back inside once they're done yelling.
	Monika	Ahaha...
	Monika	Some president I am, right?
	Monika	I can't even confront my own club members properly...
	Monika	I just wish I was able to be a little more assertive sometimes.
	Monika	But I never have it in me to put my foot down against others...
	Monika	You understand, right?
	Monika	Anyway...
	Monika	If this makes you want to spend less time with the others, then that's fine.
	Monika	I'd be happy to spend time with you instead...
	Narrator	Suddenly, Natsuki runs out of the classroom.
	Natsuki	...
	Narrator	She quickly runs away.
	Monika	Oh dear...
	Monika	...Well, it looks like they're done...
	Yuri	I didn't mean it...
	Yuri	I didn't mean it...
	Yuri	I didn't mean it...
	Narrator	Yuri is rocking back and forth in her desk with her palms on her forehead.
	MC	Yuri...?
	Yuri	I didn't mean it!!
	MC	I-I believe you...
	Narrator	I have no idea what Yuri might have said to Natsuki.
	Narrator	Or did.
	Yuri	[player].
	Yuri	Please don't hate me.
	Yuri	Please!
	Yuri	I'm not like this!
	Yuri	There's something wrong with me today...
	Monika	It's fine, Yuri.
	Monika	We know you didn't mean it.
	Monika	Besides, I'm sure Natsuki will forget all about it by tomorrow.
	Monika	Completely.
	Yuri	...
	Monika	Anyway, the meeting is over, so you can go home now if you want.
	Yuri	...
	Narrator	Yuri looks at me like she wants to say something.
	Narrator	But she keeps glancing at Monika.
	Yuri	Y-You can go first, Monika...
	Yuri	I'd like to stay a little bit longer.
	Monika	I'm the President, so I should be the last one out.
	Monika	I'll wait for you to be done.
	Yuri	...
	Yuri	...
	Yuri	Well-- I'm Vice President, so...
	Yuri	Please let me take that responsibility today.
	Monika	It kind of sounds like you don't want me around for something, Yuri.
	Yuri	I-It's not that!
	Yuri	It's not that...
	Yuri	I just...
	Yuri	I didn't get much of a chance to discuss my book with [player]...
	Yuri	It would just be...embarrassing with you listening...
	Monika	{i}*Sigh*{/i}
	Monika	I guess I don't really have a choice, do I?
	Yuri	I-I'm sorry for causing trouble...
	Yuri	But I really appreciate you understan{nw}
