	Narrator	I'm really curious to talk to Yuri a little bit more...
	Narrator	But at the same time, I would feel bad for distracting her from reading.
	Narrator	I catch a glimpse of the cover of her book.
	Narrator	It looks like the same book that she lent to me...
	Narrator	More than that, she seems to be on the first few pages.
	Yuri	Ah...
	Narrator	Crap--
	Narrator	I think she noticed me looking at her...
	Narrator	She sneaks another glance at me, and our eyes meet for a split second.
	Yuri	...
	Narrator	But that only makes her hide her face deeper in her book.
	MC	Sorry...
	MC	I was just spacing out...
	Narrator	I mutter this, sensing I made her uncomfortable.
	Yuri	Oh...
	Yuri	It's fine...
	Yuri	If I was focused, then I probably wouldn't have noticed in the first place.
	Yuri	But I'm just re-reading a bit of this, so...
	MC	That's the book that you gave me, right?
	Yuri	Mhm.
	Yuri	I wanted to re-read some of it.
	Yuri	Not for any particular reason...!
	MC	Just curious, how come you have two copies of the same book?
	Yuri	Ah...
	Yuri	Well, when I stopped at the bookstore yesterday--
	Yuri	Ah, that's not what I meant...
	Yuri	I mean--
	Yuri	I...just happened to buy two of them.
	MC	Ah, I see.
	Narrator	There's something fairly obvious here that Yuri isn't telling me, but I decide to let it go.
	MC	I'll definitely start reading it soon!
	Yuri	I'm glad to hear...
	Yuri	Once it starts to pick up, you might have a hard time putting it down.
	Yuri	It's a very engaging and relatable story.
	MC	Is that so...?
	MC	What's the story about, anyway?
	Yuri	Well...
	Yuri	Mmm...
	Narrator	I look at the cover of the book.
	Narrator	The book is titled \"Portrait of Markov\".
	Narrator	There's an ominous-looking eye symbol on the front cover.
	Yuri	Basically, it's about this religious camp that was turned into a human experiment prison...
	Yuri	And the people trapped there have this trait that turns them into killing machines that lust for blood.
	Yuri	But the facility gets even worse, and they start selectively breeding people by cutting off their limbs and affixing them to--
	Yuri	O-Oh, that might be a little bit of a spoiler...
	Yuri	But anyway, I-I'm really into it!
	Yuri	...The book, I mean!
	Yuri	N-Not the thing about the limbs...
	MC	That's kind of--!
	Narrator	That's kind of dark, isn't it?
	Narrator	Yuri made it sound like it was going to be a nice story, so that dark turn came from nowhere.
	Yuri	Ah...
	Yuri	Are you not a fan of that sort of thing, [player]?
	MC	No, it's not that...
	MC	I mean, I can definitely enjoy those kinds of stories, so don't worry.
	Yuri	I hope so...
	Narrator	Yeah... I totally forgot that Yuri is into those things.
	Narrator	She's so shy and reclusive on the outside, but her mind seems to be completely different.
	Yuri	It's just that this kind of story...
	Yuri	It's the kind that challenges you to look at life from a strange new perspective.
	Yuri	When horrible things happen not just because someone wants to be evil...
	Yuri	But because the world is full of horrible people, and we're all worthless anyway.
	Yuri	Then, suddenlyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy{nw}
	Yuri	I'm...I'm rambling, aren't I...?
	Yuri	Not again...
	Yuri	I'm sorry...
	MC	Hey, don't apologize...!
	MC	I haven't lost interest or anything.
	Yuri	Well...
	Yuri	I guess it's alright, then...
	Yuri	But I feel like I should let you know that I have this problem...
	Yuri	When I let things like books and writing fill my thoughts...
	Yuri	my whole body gets incredibly [gtext]{nw}
	Yuri	I kind of forget to pay attention to other people...
	Yuri	So I'm sorry if I end up saying something strange!
	Yuri	And please stop me if I start talking too much!
	MC	That's--
	MC	I really don't think you need to worry...
	MC	That just means you're passionate about reading.
	MC	The least I can do is listen.
	MC	It's a literature club, after all...
	Yuri	Ah--
	Yuri	That's...
	Yuri	Well, that's true...
	MC	In fact...
	MC	I might as well get started reading it, right?
	Narrator	sfx/glitch3.ogg
	Yuri	Y-Yes!
	Yuri	I-I mean, you don't have to, but...!
	MC	Ahaha, what are you saying?
	Yuri	...
	MC	Let me just get the book...
	Narrator	I quickly retrieve the book that I had put into my bag.
	MC	Alright...it's fine if I sit here, right?
	Narrator	I slip into the seat next to Yuri's.
	Yuri	Ah...!
	Yuri	Yeah...
	MC	Are you sure?
	MC	You seem a little apprehensive...
	Yuri	That's...
	Yuri	I'm sorry...
	Yuri	It's not that I don't want you to!
	Yuri	It's just something I'm not very used to...
	Yuri	That is, reading in company with someone.
	MC	I see...
	MC	Well, just tell me if I end up distracting you or anything.
	Yuri	A-Alright...
	Narrator	I open the book and start the prologue.
	Narrator	I soon understand what Yuri means about reading in company.
	Narrator	It's as if I can feel her presence over my shoulder as I read.
	Narrator	It's not a particularly bad thing.
	Narrator	Maybe a little distracting, but the feeling is somewhat comforting.
	Narrator	Yuri is in the corner of my eye.
	Narrator	I realize that she's not actually looking at her own book.
	Narrator	I glance over.
	Narrator	It looks like she's reading from my book instead--
	Yuri	S-Sorry!
	Yuri	I was just--!{nw}
	Yuri	I was just{fast} bathing in the feeling of your body heat tttttttttttttheat eattttttt{nw}
	MC	Yuri, you really apologize a lot, don't you?
	Yuri	I...I do?
	Yuri	I don't really mean to...
	Yuri	Sorry...
	Yuri	I mean--!
	MC	Ahaha.
	MC	Here, this should work, right?
	Narrator	I slide my desk until it's up against Yuri's, then hold my book more between the two of them.
	Yuri	Ah...
	Yuri	I-I suppose so...
	Narrator	Yuri timidly closes her own copy.
	Narrator	Once we each lean in a little bit, our shoulders are almost touching.
	Narrator	It feels like my left arm is in the way, so instead I use my right hand to hold the book open.
	MC	Ah, I guess that makes it kind of difficult to turn the page...
	Yuri	Here...
	Narrator	Yuri takes her left arm and holds the left side of the book between her thumb and forefinger.
	MC	Ah...
	Narrator	I do the same with my right arm, on the right side of the book.
	Narrator	That way, I turn a page, and Yuri slides it under her thumb after it flips to her side.
	Narrator	But in holding it like this...
	Narrator	We're huddled even closer together than before.
	Narrator	It's actually kind of distracting me...!
	Narrator	It's as if I can feel the warmth of Yuri's face, and she's in the corner of my vision...
	Yuri	...Are you ready?
	MC	Eh?
	Yuri	To turn the page...
	MC	Ah...sorry!
	MC	I think I got a bit distracted for a second...
	Narrator	I glance over at Yuri's face again, and our eyes meet.
	Narrator	I don't know how I'll be able to keep up with her...
	Yuri	Ah...
	Yuri	That's okay.
	Yuri	You're not as used to reading, right?
	Yuri	I don't mind being patient if it takes you a bit longer...
	Yuri	It's probably the least I can do...
	Yuri	Since you've been so patient with me...
	MC	Y-Yeah...
	MC	Thanks.
	Narrator	We continue reading.
	Narrator	Yuri no longer asks me if I'm ready to turn the page.
	Narrator	Instead, I just assume that she finishes the page before me, so I turn it by my own volition.
	Narrator	We continue the first chapter in silence.
	Narrator	Even so, turning each page almost feels like an intimate exchange...
	Narrator	My thumb gently letting go of the page, letting it flutter over to her side as she catches it under her own thumb.
	MC	Hey, Yuri...
	MC	This might be a silly thought, but...
	MC	The main character kind of reminds me of you a little bit.
	Yuri	E-Eh??
	Yuri	N-No, I don't relate to this character at all!
	Yuri	Definitely not!
	MC	Really...?
	MC	I was just thinking the way she second-guesses things she says, and all that...
	Yuri	A-Ah...
	Yuri	That's what you were talking about...
	Yuri	Sorry...
	Yuri	I thought you meant...something else about her.
	MC	Something else...?
	Yuri	N-Never mind!
	Yuri	We didn't even get that far yet...
	Yuri	So I don't know why that came into my head...
	Yuri	Ahaha!
	MC	Yuri, are you feeling alright?
	Yuri	Eh--?
	Narrator	Yuri's been a little fidgety ever since we started reading...
	MC	You can rest if you're feeling sick or something.
	MC	Your breathing is a little...
	Yuri	My breathing...?
	Narrator	Yuri puts her hands on her chest, as if to feel her heartbeat.
	Yuri	I-I didn't...even notice...
	Yuri	...Anyway, I'm fine!
	Yuri	I just need some water...!
	MC	Alright...don't push yourself.
	Narrator	Yuri stands up and practically rushes out of the classroom.
	MC	What on Earth was that about...?
	Monika	[player]?
	Monika	Did something happen just now?
	MC	Eh?
	MC	I have no idea...
	MC	Yuri was acting a little strange, I guess...
	Monika	So you don't know anything...
	MC	Sorry, I can't say I do.
	MC	Are you worried about her?
	Monika	Oh...no, not really.
	Monika	I was just making sure that you didn't do anything to her.
	MC	N-No, nothing!
	Monika	Ahaha, don't worry...I believe you, silly.
	Monika	Yuri just does this sometimes, so it's nothing alarming.
	MC	Alright...if you say so.
	Monika	Anyway, why don't we start with sharing our poems with each other?
	MC	Eh?
	MC	Shouldn't we wait for Yuri?
	Monika	Well, she might be a while, so I just figured we'd get started without her.
	Monika	Is that okay?
	MC	Yeah, I was just asking...
	Narrator	I stand up.
	Narrator	I make a mental note of where I left off in the book, then slip it back into my bag.
	MC	Hey, Yuri.
	Yuri	Eh?
	MC	Ah...
	Narrator	I suddenly notice that Yuri is reading a different book from the one we've been reading together.
	MC	Sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt...
	Yuri	Ah, no...
	Yuri	I was kind of just waiting for you...
	MC	Ah, if that's the case...
	MC	Why don't we go ahead and get started?
	Yuri	Yes, let's!
	Yuri	Actually, I have a request...
	Yuri	...Do you mind if I make some tea first?
	MC	Not at all.
	Yuri	Thanks very much.
	Yuri	If there's one thing that can make my reading time here any better, it's a nice cup of tea.
	Yuri	Not to mention for yourself, as well.
	Narrator	Yuri stands up and makes her way to the closet.
	Narrator	I follow and watch as she retrieves a small water pitcher from the shelf - the kind with a filter inside.
	Yuri	Can you hold this for a second?
	MC	Sure...
	Narrator	Yuri hands me the water pitcher and also fetches an electric kettle.
	Yuri	I'm going to plug this in at the teacher's desk, and then I'll go get some water.
	Narrator	She walks past me and sets the kettle down on the teacher's desk.
	Narrator	I simply watch her movements.
	Narrator	To my surprise, the way she moves really contrasts her speaking mannerisms.
	Narrator	Especially because of her long legs, Yuri appears elegant and methodical.
	Yuri	Okay, may I have the water pitcher?
	Yuri	Thanks. I'll be right back.
	MC	Ah, I might as well walk with you...
	Yuri	T-That's okay!
	Yuri	You stay here...
	Yuri	It won't take long.
	Narrator	Pitcher in hand, Yuri hurries out of the classroom.
	Monika	Ah...
	Monika	Did Yuri leave you again?
	MC	No, it's not like that this time.
	MC	She's just filling up the water pitcher to make tea.
	Monika	Oh, okay!
	Monika	Sorry for misunderstanding~
	Narrator	...
	Narrator	Ten minutes pass.
	Narrator	Yuri said it wouldn't take long...
	Narrator	Is something holding her up?
	Narrator	I'm bored just waiting here, so I decide to go look for her.
	Narrator	<from " + str(currentpos) + " loop 10.893>bgm/6o.ogg
	MC	Let's see...
	Narrator	The most logical place for Yuri to be would be the nearest water fountain...
	Narrator	Yuri
	Narrator	I start heading down the hallway.
	Narrator	???
	Yuri	Haah.....haah....
	Yuri	....Haah.....haah....
	Narrator	...What's that noise?
	Narrator	It's coming from around the corner...
	Narrator	It sounds like breathing.
	Yuri	Khhhhh--
	Narrator	A sharp inhale, like someone is sucking the air through their teeth.
	Narrator	Are they in pain...?
	Narrator	I reach the corner and peer around it.
	MC	Yuri...?
	Narrator	Yuri
	Yuri	Kya--!

	Narrator	<from " + str(currentpos) + " loop 10.893>bgm/6.ogg
	Yuri	I'm back.
	Yuri	Thanks for waiting patiently.
	Yuri	[player], do you like oolong tea?
	MC	Ah, yeah.
	MC	Anything is fine.
	Yuri	Very well.
	Narrator	Yuri sets the temperature on the kettle to 200 degrees.
	Yuri	Now it's time to get the teapot.
	MC	You really do this properly, don't you?
	Yuri	Of course...
	Yuri	I shouldn't do any less when I'm making tea for others.
	MC	Even if I'm not an expert on tea or anything...?
	Yuri	Huhu.
	Yuri	In that case, you'll only be even more impressed.
	MC	Ah...perhaps I will!
	Narrator	Yuri fetches the teapot and begins measuring the tea leaves.
	Narrator	To my surprise, she even starts humming a little to herself.
	MC	You must be in a good mood now...
	Yuri	Is that so?
	Yuri	I was letting it show...
	Yuri	And you noticed.
	Yuri	I was doing a bit of thinking...
	Yuri	And I decided that I would try expressing myself a little bit more.
	Yuri	It turns out it's not very hard for me to do...
	Yuri	When it's you who's around, anyway.
	MC	Ah...
	MC	That's great, Yuri!
	MC	Just don't push yourself too much.
	Yuri	You're always worrying about me, [player]...
	Yuri	It's very endearing.
	MC	That's...
	Narrator	Yuri wasn't kidding...
	Narrator	I don't even know if I can keep up with this...!
	Narrator	I watch Yuri pour a cup of tea for each of us.
	Yuri	[player], I have another request.
	Yuri	Do you mind if we sit on the floor today?
	MC	Eh? Why's that?
	Yuri	It's a little bit easier on my back...
	Yuri	I can read with my back against the wall rather than bending over at my desk.
	MC	Ah, sorry, I didn't realize.
	Yuri	No worries.
	Yuri	I just have back pain fairly regularly, so I do my best to manage it.
	MC	Is that so?
	MC	I wonder why that is...
	Yuri	It's most likely because my--
	Yuri	Ah--
	Yuri	M-My...
	MC	Your posture, right?
	MC	Always hunched over like that while reading...
	Yuri	Yes!
	Yuri	I have terrible reading posture!
	Yuri	So that's why we should sit on the floor.
	MC	Fair enough.
	MC	I'll go ahead and get the book.
	Narrator	I retrieve the book from my bag.
	MC	Ah, I have some chocolate as well...
	Narrator	It's a bag of small chocolate candies.
	Narrator	I take it, since it'll go well with the tea.
	Narrator	Yuri and I then sit against the wall, teacups at our sides.
	Narrator	As if in sync, we assume the same reading position as last time, each holding one half of the book.
	Narrator	Except this time...
	Narrator	Our bodies are even closer to each other.
	Yuri	I can't see too well...
	MC	--!
	Narrator	Yuri slides closer until our shoulders are touching.
	Narrator	How am I supposed to focus on reading like this...?!
	Narrator	Yuri was always kind of cute, but...
	Narrator	When she's being less apprehensive, it's almost more than I can handle!
	Yuri	Your teacup...
	Narrator	Yuri hands me my teacup.
	Narrator	Holding it with my hand that's not holding the book, I end up in a position that makes it even harder to focus.
	Narrator	Because now I need to worry about making sure I don't accidentally touch her chest...!
	Narrator	Meanwhile, Yuri hasn't noticed a single thing.
	Narrator	She wears her intense reading expression, and I can only presume the world around her has faded away.
	Narrator	I use all of my willpower to focus on reading.
	Narrator	...
	Narrator	After a few minutes, I finally manage to relax a little.
	Narrator	I put the teacup between my legs and fumble with the chocolate wrapper.
	MC	Ah, sorry...
	Narrator	I briefly let go of the book to finish opening the wrapper.
	MC	You can have as much as you want.
	Yuri	Ah, that's...
	Yuri	That's okay, I won't take any...
	MC	Eh? Are you sure?
	Yuri	Well...
	Yuri	If I touch it, then it might get smudges on the pages...
	MC	Ah, you're right...
	MC	I didn't even think about that.
	MC	My bad...
	Yuri	No need to apologize.
	Yuri	I'll hold the book, okay?
	MC	Are you sure...?
	Yuri	Of course.
	Narrator	Yuri opens the book with both hands.
	Narrator	She holds it so that I don't have any harder of a time reading from it.
	Narrator	But as a result, her left arm is practically resting on top of my leg.
	MC	Well, in that case...
	Narrator	Yuri is already totally focused on reading again.
	Narrator	I take a chocolate candy and pop it into my mouth.
	Narrator	Then, I take another chocolate...
	Narrator	And I hold it up to Yuri.
	Narrator	She doesn't even look away from the book.
	Narrator	She simply parts her lips, as if this situation was completely natural.
	Narrator	But that means I can't stop here!
	Narrator	I apprehensively place the chocolate in her mouth.
	Narrator	Just like that, Yuri closes her lips over it.
	Yuri	Eh...?
	Narrator	Yuri's expression suddenly breaks.
	Yuri	Did...
	Yuri	Did I just...
	Narrator	Yuri looks at me like she needs to confirm what just happened.
	Yuri	U-Um...
	Yuri	[player]...
	MC	S-Sorry!
	MC	I guess I shouldn't have done that...
	Yuri	A-Ah...
	Narrator	Yuri starts to breathe heavily.
	Yuri	I...
	Yuri	I can't...
	Yuri	[player]...
	Narrator	Suddenly, Yuri forcefully grabs my arm and jerks me to my feet.
	Narrator	My teacup gets knocked over.
	Yuri	[player]...
	Yuri	My heart...
	Yuri	My heart won't stop pounding, [player]...
	Yuri	I can't calm down.
	Yuri	I can't focus on anything anymore...!
	Yuri	Can you feel it, [player]?
	Narrator	Yuri suddenly presses my hand against her chest.
	Yuri	Why is this happening to me?
	Yuri	I feel like I'm losing my mind...
	Yuri	I can't make it stop.
	Yuri	It even makes me not want to read...
	Yuri	I just want...
	Yuri	...to look...
	Yuri	...at you.
	Yuri	...Haah...
	Yuri	...Haah...
	Yuri	...Haah...
	Monika	U-Um...
	Monika	It's...time to share poems...
	Narrator	<loop 10.893>bgm/6g.ogg
	Yuri	[gtext]{nw}
	Yuri	Um...
	Yuri	Wait...
	Yuri	How did I...
	Yuri	...Sorry, I just had a really weird déjà vu...
	Yuri	This hasn't happened before or anything...right?
	Yuri	My head has been a little fuzzy lately...
	Yuri	I hope it hasn't really been showing or anything!
	Yuri	I would hate for you to think I'm weird just after we started spending time together...
	Yuri	I mean...
	Yuri	Everyone has a few unusual things about them.
	Yuri	But expressing those things so soon after meeting someone is usually seen as inappropriate...or unlikable.
	Yuri	At least, that's what I've discovered.
	Yuri	When I was a bit younger, I think I would come on really strongly and get a little too intense...
	Yuri	It made people not want to be around me.
	Yuri	So...I started hating those things about myself.
	Yuri	My obsession with certain hobbies.
	Yuri	And the way I can't control myself when I get too excited about something.
	Yuri	So...
	Yuri	I eventually stopped trying to talk to people.
	Yuri	If nobody could ever like me for the things that matter most to me...
	Yuri	...Then it's just easier if I close myself off.
	Yuri	But recently, something's been wrong.
	Yuri	I don't know what it is.
	Yuri	But every time we come to the club, my heart starts to go crazy.
	Yuri	Like it's going to rip out of my chest.
	Yuri	It overwhelms me with energy and emotions that I can't let out.
	Yuri	It's been making me do weird things.
	Yuri	I don't know why it's happening!
	Yuri	[player]...
	Yuri	Is it just me, or has Monika been acting a little off lately?
	Yuri	She's always been a sweetheart ever since I joined the club...
	Yuri	But recently, I've been feeling something sharp whenever she's around.
	Yuri	I'm not crazy, right?
	Yuri	Please tell me I'm not!
	Yuri	I couldn't say anything before, because she's always listening!
	Yuri	But finally, we're alone...
	Yuri	Can we just stay here for a while?
	Yuri	Yeah...
	Yuri	...
	Narrator	yuri/eyesfull.png
	Yuri	I just want to stay here.
	Yuri	Just the two of us.
	Yuri	We can stay here until the club ends.
	Yuri	And then we'll have the clubroom all to ourselves.
	Yuri	Nobody to interfere with our reading time.
	Yuri	Nobody to make me feel like stabbing myself in the throat.
	Yuri	Ahaha...
	Yuri	That was a joke!
	Yuri	Just a joke.
	Yuri	I do like knives, though...
	Yuri	It sounds strange, but you wouldn't understand if you've never seen how beautiful they can be.
	Yuri	I have an idea.
	Yuri	Why don't you come to my house sometime?
	Yuri	I can show you my collection.
	Yuri	I've gotten them all from various artisans.
	Yuri	I make sure to give them all their fair share of use.
	Yuri	I don't want them to get lonely or anything...
	Yuri	Nobody deserves to be lonely.
	Yuri	Nobody.
	Yuri	And that's why I'm so happy you joined the Literature Club, [player].
	Yuri	Now we don't need to be lonely anymore.
	Yuri	Because we have each other.
	Yuri	Every day.
	Yuri	That's all we need.
	Yuri	You know what?
	Yuri	Let's quit the Literature Club.
	Yuri	There's no need for us to be around Monika's slimy tongue anymore.
	Yuri	Not to mention that other pathetic child.
	Yuri	We can walk home together every day after school.
	Yuri	And read together.
	Yuri	Eat together.
	Yuri	Sleep together.
	Yuri	Doesn't that sound perfect?
	Yuri	It's everything we could ever want.
	Yuri	Isn't that why you joined the club in the first place?
	Yuri	It's almost like it was fate.
	Yuri	Fate that we would meet each other.
	Yuri	And now we get the happy ending that I've patiently waited years for.
	Yuri	Will you do that with me, [player]?
	Yuri	Will{space=60}[gtext]{nw}
