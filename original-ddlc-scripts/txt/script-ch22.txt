	Narrator	Another day passes, and it's time for the club meeting already.
	Narrator	I've gotten a little more comfortable here over the past couple days.
	Narrator	Entering the clubroom, the usual scene greets me.
	Yuri	Welcome back, [player]...
	MC	Ah, hi Yuri...
	Narrator	I'm not sure if it's me, or if it's Yuri's expression...
	Narrator	But the weight of yesterday's quarrel still hangs in the air a little.
	Yuri	U-Um...
	Narrator	Yuri glances over her shoulder, looking around the room.
	Narrator	Natsuki is reading manga at a desk.
	Narrator	And surprisingly, Monika isn't here yet.
	Narrator	Suddenly, Yuri takes my arm and pulls me to the corner of the room.
	Yuri	About yesterday...
	Yuri	I...
	Yuri	I really need to apologize.
	Yuri	Nothing like that has ever happened before...
	Yuri	And...something just came over me, I guess...
	Yuri	I wasn't acting mentally sound.
	Yuri	Please don't think we're usually like this!
	Yuri	Not just me, but Natsuki as well...
	MC	Yuri...
	MC	I'm happy that you were considerate and apologized.
	MC	You don't have to worry too much.
	MC	Even though I've only been here a couple days, I could tell something was off yesterday...
	MC	Maybe we were just a little extra sensitive because it was our first time sharing poems.
	MC	But whatever it was...
	MC	It didn't make me think any less of you.
	MC	I had already decided that there's no way you can be a bad person.
	MC	And now that you're apologizing, I know you really didn't mean it.
	Yuri	A-Ah...
	Yuri	[player]...
	Yuri	Don't say those kinds of things so frankly...
	Yuri	They make me a little too happy.
	Yuri	I'm really glad that you're such an understanding person...
	Yuri	And I'm really glad that you joined this club.
	Yuri	Everything is a little bit brighter with you around, and--
	Yuri	Ah--
	Yuri	Sorry, what am I saying right now...?
	Yuri	I just--
	Natsuki	Hey, have you guys seen Monika?
	Yuri	Ah--!
	MC	No, I haven't...
	MC	I was also kind of wondering where she was.
	Natsuki	Man...
	Natsuki	Yuri, I'm guessing you haven't, either?
	Yuri	...
	Narrator	Yuri is clearly taken aback by how calmly Natsuki is addressing her.
	Yuri	N-No, I haven't...
	Natsuki	Jeez, this isn't like her at all.
	Natsuki	I know it's stupid, but I can't help but worry a little bit...
	Yuri	...
	Natsuki	What?
	Natsuki	Why're you looking at me like that?
	Yuri	U-Um...
	Yuri	Natsuki, about yesterday...
	Yuri	I-I just wanted to apologize!
	Yuri	I promise I didn't mean any of the things I said!
	Yuri	And I'll do my best to stay under control from now on...
	Yuri	So--
	Natsuki	Yuri, what the heck are you talking about?
	Natsuki	Did you do something yesterday?
	Yuri	...Eh?
	Natsuki	Jeez...
	Natsuki	Whatever's on your mind, I'm sure it was nothing.
	Natsuki	I don't even remember anything bad happening.
	Natsuki	You're the kind of person who worries too much about the little things, aren't you?
	Yuri	...
	Yuri	B-But...
	Natsuki	mibulls sailcloth blindsight lifeline anan rectipetality faultlessly offered scleromalacia neighed catholicate
	Natsuki	I'll accept your apology anyway, if it helps you feel better about it.
	Natsuki	Besides, it's kinda nice to hear, since I was always afraid you secretly hated me or something like that.
	Natsuki	Ehehe.
	Yuri	N-No, not at all...!
	Yuri	I don't hate you...
	Natsuki	Ahaha.
	Natsuki	Well, you're kind of weird, but I don't hate you either.
	Yuri	...
	Narrator	Natsuki turns to me.
	Natsuki	You're still on trial, though.
	MC	Hey...!
	Narrator	Suddenly, the door swings open.
	Monika	Sorry! I'm super sorry!
	MC	Ah, there you are...
	Monika	I didn't mean to be late...
	Monika	I hope you guys weren't worried or anything!
	MC	Nah...
	MC	Well, Natsuki was.
	Natsuki	I-I was not!!
	Monika	Ahaha.
	Natsuki	...What took you so long, anyway?
	Monika	Ah...
	Monika	Well, my last period today was study hall.
	Monika	To be honest, I kind of just lost track of time...
	Monika	Ahaha...
	Natsuki	That makes no sense, though.
	Natsuki	You would have heard the bell ring, at least.
	Monika	I must not have heard it, since I was practicing piano...
	Yuri	Piano...?
	Yuri	I wasn't aware you played music as well, Monika.
	Monika	Ah, don't give me more credit than I deserve.
	Monika	I guess I've been practicing for a while, but I'm still not really good yet.
	Yuri	Still...
	Yuri	That must require a lot of dedication.
	Yuri	So, I'm still impressed.
	Monika	Aw, well thanks, Yuri~
	Natsuki	You should play something for us sometime!
	Monika	Ahaha, that's...
	Narrator	Monika looks at me.
	Monika	Well, I am working on writing a song, but it's not quite done yet...
	Monika	Maybe once I get a little bit better, I will.
	MC	That sounds cool.
	MC	I look forward to it.
	Monika	Is that so?
	Monika	In that case...
	Monika	I won't let you down, [player].
	Narrator	Monika smiles sweetly.
	MC	Ah...
	MC	I didn't mean any pressure or anything like that!
	Monika	Ahaha, don't worry.
	Monika	I was hoping that I could share it with you, anyway.
	Monika	I guess that's why I've been practicing so much recently.
	MC	I see...
	Narrator	I'm not sure if Monika was referring to the whole club, or just me...
	MC	In that case, best of luck.
	Monika	Thanks~!
	Monika	So, I didn't miss anything, did I?
	MC	Not...not really.
	Narrator	I choose not to bring up anything that the three of us talked about.
	Narrator	Besides, Natsuki has already run off into the closet.
	Yuri	[player]...
	Yuri	Um...
	Yuri	Since your compliments put me in a good mood...
	Yuri	I was wondering if you would like to spend some time together today.
	Yuri	I mean--in the club!
	Narrator	natsuki
	MC	Ah, I suppose so.
	MC	I don't think I could say no to you, after you gave that book to me.
	MC	Well, I guess I need to make sure Natsuki isn't waiting for me.
	MC	After we finished reading yesterday, she--
	Yuri	She's fine!
	Yuri	She's reading over there. See?
	Yuri	Don't think about her so much.
	Yuri	She's used to being ignored.
	Yuri	Come on, we're going over there.
	Narrator	<from " + str(currentpos) + " loop 10.893>bgm/6.ogg
	Yuri	S-She's fine!
	Yuri	She's reading over there.
	Yuri	So it's okay, right?
	MC	Ah--
	MC	In that case, I don't see any problem...
	MC	Yeah, definitely.
	MC	I planned on it anyway.
	Yuri	Okay!
	Yuri	Can we start now?
	Yuri	Let's find a place to sit--
	Yuri	A-Ah--
	Yuri	I'm being a little forceful, aren't I...?
	Yuri	I'm sorry!
	Yuri	My heart...just won't stop pounding, for some reason...
	MC	Don't worry about it.
	MC	If anything, it's nice to see you have so much energy.
	Yuri	Y-Yeah!
	Yuri	But...
	Yuri	I need to try to calm down.
	Yuri	I won't be able to focus on reading like this...
	MC	Take your time.
	Narrator	Yuri takes a deep breath, then pulls a copy of the book out of her bag.

	Monika	Okay, everyone!
	Monika	We're all done reading each other's poems, right?
	Monika	We have something we need to go over today, so if everyone could come sit at the front of the room...
	Natsuki	Is this about the festival?
	Monika	Well, sort of~
	Natsuki	Ugh. Do we really have to do something for the festival?
	Natsuki	It's not like we can put together anything good in just a few days.
	Natsuki	We'll just end up embarrassing ourselves instead of getting any new members.
	Yuri	That's a concern of mine as well.
	Narrator	<from " + str(currentpos) + " loop 4.618>bgm/3.ogg
	Yuri	I don't really do well with last-minute preparations...
	Monika	Don't worry so much!
	Monika	We're going to keep it simple, okay?
	Monika	Look...
	Monika	I know everyone's been a little more...lively...ever since [player] joined and we've started with some club activities.
	Monika	But this isn't the time for us to become complacent.
	Monika	We still only have four members...
	Monika	And the festival is our only real chance to find more, you know?
	Natsuki	What's so great about getting new members, anyway?
	Natsuki	We already have enough to be considered an official club.
	Natsuki	More members will just mean everything gets noisier and more difficult to manage.
	Monika	Natsuki...
	Monika	I don't think you're looking at it the right way at all.
	Monika	Don't you want to share your passion with as many people as you can?
	Monika	To inspire them to find the same feelings that brought you here in the first place?
	Monika	The Literature Club should be a place where people can express themselves like they can't do anywhere else.
	Monika	It should be a place so intimate that you never want to leave.
	Monika	I know you feel that way, too.
	Monika	I know we all do!
	Monika	So that's why we should work hard and put something together for the festival...even if it's something small!
	Monika	Right, [player]?
	MC	Ah...
	Natsuki	Oh, come on!
	Natsuki	You can't take advantage of [player] to agree with you just because he doesn't know how to say no to anything.
	Natsuki	Look, Monika.
	Natsuki	Do you really think any of us here joined the club with other people in mind?
	Natsuki	Yuri never even talked until [player] joined.
	Natsuki	As for me, I just like it better here than I do at home.
	Natsuki	And [player] isn't even passionate about literature in the first place.
	Natsuki	And that's everyone.
	Natsuki	Sorry, but you're really the only one who's so interested in finding new members.
	Natsuki	The rest of us are fine like this.
	Natsuki	I know you're President and all, but you should really consider our opinions for once.
	Monika	...
	Narrator	Monika is clearly taken aback by Natsuki's words.
	Monika	That's...not true at all.
	Monika	I'm sure Yuri and [player] want to get more members too...
	Monika	...Right?
	Yuri	...
	MC	...
	Narrator	I don't know about Yuri, but I'm kind of indifferent.
	Narrator	If I showed as much enthusiasm as Monika wanted, then I would probably be lying.
	Narrator	Still, if it's up to me to rescue this situation...
	MC	Um--
	Monika	No.
	Monika	Natsuki's right, isn't she?
	Monika	This club...
	Monika	It's nothing more than a place for a few people to hang out.
	Monika	Why did I think that everyone here saw it the same way as I did?
	MC	But that doesn't mean that we're against getting new members or anything...
	Monika	[player], why did you even join this club?
	Monika	What were you hoping to get out of it?
	MC	Well--
	Narrator	That's not really something I can be honest about, is it?
	Monika	In fact...
	Monika	If I remember, you weren't even given a choice not to join.
	Narrator	Monika sits down and stares at her desk.
	Monika	What's the point of all this, anyway?
	Monika	What if starting this club was a mistake?
	MC	...
	Yuri	Now you've done it, Natsuki...
	Natsuki	What, me?
	Natsuki	I just spoke my mind...
	Natsuki	Is it a crime to be honest?
	Yuri	It's not about being honest.
	Yuri	It's about word choice.
	Yuri	Besides, you have no right to speak for everyone else in the club like that...
	Natsuki	You don't understand at all!
	Natsuki	I just...
	Natsuki	I just want a place that feels nice to hang out with a few friends.
	Natsuki	Is there a problem with the club being that for me?
	Natsuki	There aren't...there aren't many other places like that for me...
	Natsuki	And now Monika wants to take it away from me!
	MC	She's not taking anything away--
	Natsuki	No, [player].
	Natsuki	It's not the same.
	Natsuki	It won't be the same with the direction she wants to take it.
	Natsuki	If I wanted that, then I could have just joined any other stupid club.
	Natsuki	But this one...
	Natsuki	I mean...
	Natsuki	At least for a little bit of time...
	Natsuki	Things were nice.
	Narrator	Natsuki starts packing up her things.
	Natsuki	I'm going home.
	Natsuki	I feel like...I don't belong here right now.
	Yuri	Natsuki...
	Narrator	Natsuki ignores Yuri and walks right out of the classroom.
	Yuri	...
	Yuri	This is bad...
	Yuri	I don't know what to do...
	MC	Well...
	MC	Do you have an opinion on the festival?
	Yuri	I-I don't know...
	Yuri	I'm kind of indifferent, I guess...
	Narrator	<from " + str(currentpos) + " loop 1.532>bgm/9g.ogg
	Yuri	Who cares about that obnoxious brat?
	Narrator	<from " + str(currentpos) + " loop 3.172>bgm/9.ogg
	Yuri	I mean, I like how nice and quiet the club is right now...
	Yuri	And I'm just...happy with you here...
	Yuri	But still!
	Yuri	I'm the Vice President...
	Yuri	It's not right for me to ignore my responsibilities like that...
	Narrator	<from " + str(currentpos) + " loop 1.532>bgm/9g.ogg
	Yuri	Nobody would cry if she killed herself.
	Narrator	sfx/stab.ogg
	Narrator	<from " + str(currentpos) + " loop 3.172>bgm/9.ogg
	Yuri	I should do my best to consider everyone's perspective and make the decision that's right for the club.
	Yuri	But what about you, [player]?
	Yuri	What do you want to get out of this club?
	Narrator	Yuri repeats the same question as Monika.
	Narrator	I decide giving an indirect answer is better than nothing.
	MC	...I think the most important thing is for everyone to get along...
	MC	...And for the club to provide something that you can't get anywhere else.
	MC	I don't think it's about how many members, but rather the quality of each member.
	MC	That's what will end up making the Literature Club a special place.
	Yuri	I see...
	Yuri	I really agree with you.
	Yuri	Each member contributes their own qualities in a special way.
	Yuri	With each change in members, the identity of the club as a whole will change, too.
	Yuri	I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.
	Yuri	Stepping out of your comfort zone once in a while...
	Yuri	So if you would like to help Monika with the festival, then I'm on your side as well.
	MC	Alright.
	MC	Well, maybe we can all talk to Natsuki tomorrow...
	Narrator	Yuri nods.
	Monika	Hey, Yuri...
	Yuri	Eh?
	Monika	Um, I know things were a little awkward yesterday...
	Monika	But I feel like you deserve to know that I still think you're a wonderful vice president.
	Monika	And also, a wonderful friend.
	Yuri	M-Monika...
	Monika	I want to do everything I can to make this the best club ever.
	Monika	Okay?
	Yuri	...Me too.
	Monika	Yeah...
	Monika	Let's all go home for today.
	Monika	We'll talk about the festival tomorrow.
	Yuri	Okay.
	Yuri	I look forward to it.
	Yuri	Shall we go, [player]?
	Monika	Um--
	Monika	Please don't take this the wrong way, but...
	Monika	I'm going to chat a little bit with [player] before we leave.
	Monika	Just to see what he thinks of his time here and all that...
	Monika	It's important to me, as President.
	Yuri	...
	Narrator	Yuri looks a little troubled, but she doesn't protest.
	Yuri	Okay.
	Yuri	I trust your judgment, Monika.
	Yuri	In that case, I'll see the two of you tomorrow.
	Monika	See you tomorrow~
	Narrator	Monika waves as Yuri exits the classroom.
	Monika	Phew...
	Monika	Things have been a bit hectic lately, haven't they?
	Monika	[player], I just wanted to make sure you're enjoying your time at this club.
	Monika	I would really hate to see you unhappy.
	Monika	I feel kind of like I'm responsible for that, as President...
	Monika	And I really do care about you...you know?
	Monika	I don't like seeing the other girls give you a hard time.
	Monika	With how mean Natsuki is and everything...
	Monika	And Yuri being a little bit...you know.
	Monika	Ahaha...
	Monika	Sometimes it feels like you and I are the only real people here.
	Monika	You know what I mean?
	Monika	But it's weird, because in all the time you've been here, we've hardly gotten to spend any time together.
	Monika	Ah...I mean...
	Monika	I guess it's technically only been a couple days...
	Monika	Sorry, I didn't mean to say something weird!
	Monika	There are just some things I've been hoping to talk about with you...
	Monika	Things I know only you could understand.
	Monika	So that's why--\"{space=5000}{w=0.75}{nw}
	Monika	Wait, not yet!\"{space=5000}{w=0.5}{nw}
	Monika	No!\"{space=5000}{w=0.5}{nw}
	Monika	Stop it!\"{space=5000}{w=1.0}{nw}
